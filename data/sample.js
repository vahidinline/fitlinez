You can also perform the exercise with your hands on dumbbells to decrease the strain on your wrists.\n",

The barbell should hang directly below your shoulders.\n\n3-Pull the barbell up towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body and your shoulders down and back.\n\n4-Lower the barbell back down to the starting position, and repeat the movement for your desired number of repetitions.\n\n*It's important to keep your back straight and avoid using momentum to lift the weight to prevent injury. Additionally, make sure to use a weight that you can lift comfortably without straining your muscles. If you're new to the exercise, start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable and confident with the movement.\n",

      "Assisted triceps dips can also be performed using an assisted dip machine. Here's how to perform the exercise:\n\n1-Adjust the weight on the machine to a level that provides the appropriate amount of assistance for your fitness level.\n\n2-Stand on the footrests of the machine and grasp the handles with your hands, keeping your elbows close to your body.\n\n3-Lower your body down by bending your elbows, keeping your chest up and your shoulders down.\n\n4-Once your upper arms are parallel to the ground, push yourself back up to the starting position, squeezing your triceps muscles at the top of the movement.\n\n5-Repeat for the desired number of reps.\n\n*Remember to keep your core tight and your body upright throughout the exercise. You can adjust the weight on the machine to make the exercise easier or harder as needed. Also, be sure to use a weight that allows you to maintain proper form throughout the exercise.\n\n",

      "The reverse fly machine is a weight training exercise that targets the muscles of the upper back, particularly the rear deltoids and rhomboids. Here are the steps to perform the reverse fly machine exercise:\n\n1-Adjust the seat of the machine so that the handles are level with your shoulders.\n\n2-Sit on the machine with your chest against the back pad and your feet flat on the ground.\n\n3-Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, and make sure your arms are fully extended.\n\n4-Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull the handles back towards your chest.\n\n5-Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly release back to the starting position.\n\n6-Repeat the movement for your desired number of repetitions.\n\n*It's important to use proper form and avoid using momentum to lift the weight to prevent injury. Additionally, make sure to use a weight that you can lift comfortably without straining your muscles. If you're new to the exercise, start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable and confident with the movement.\n\n",

Hold for a brief second at the top and then slowly lower back to the starting position.\n\nPersonal Trainer Tips: As with all exercises, posture is very important. Make sure that your back does not arch excessively when you press over head.\n\n2 Different Arm Positions\n\nThe lever shoulder press can be performed with different grips and hand positions, providing variety to your shoulder training.\n\nMost machines have 2 different arm positions (abducted or neutral).\n\nIn the neutral position, your arms are facing each other.\nIn the abducted position the arms are out to the side and facing forwards.\nTry both grips and stick with the one that you like the most.\n\nPressing over head is a great way to strengthen the shoulder muscles, but use caution if you have a history of shoulder or neck pain.',

Here are the steps to perform the barbell bent over row:\n\n1-Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and grip the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2-Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged. The barbell should hang directly below your shoulders.\n\n3-Pull the barbell up towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body and your shoulders down and back.\n\n4-Lower the barbell back down to the starting position, and repeat the movement for your desired number of repetitions.\n\n*It's important to keep your back straight and avoid using momentum to lift the weight to prevent injury. Additionally, make sure to use a weight that you can lift comfortably without straining your muscles. If you're new to the exercise, start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable and confident with the movement.\n",
